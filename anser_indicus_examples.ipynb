        " {u'content': u'Iran\\'s parliament has summoned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for questioning over a long list of accusations including mismanagement of the nation\\'s economy. The summons was the first of its kind for an Iranian president since 1979. It follows a petition by a group of legislators for a review of policy decisions by Ahmadinejad, who has come under increasing attacks in recent months from the same people who brought him to power. It is also part of a power struggle on the Iranian political scene ahead of March 2 parliamentary elections and the 2013 presidential vote. Mohammad Reza Bahnoar, the parliament deputy speaker, on Tuesday said lawmakers have demanded that Ahmadinejad answer a slew of questions on the economy, including purportedly bypassing a special budget for the Tehran subway and public transportation. He is also to be queried about foreign and domestic policy decisions. \"There is a requirement for the president to answer questions in an open session of the parliament,\" said Bahnoar, whose parliament speech was broadcast live on Iranian state radio. A letter containing the summons is to be sent to Ahmadinejad in next two days, according to the parliament statement. Under Iranian law, he has up to appear in parliament after one month. It is unclear what would happen if Ahmadinejad fails to appear before parliament. Ahmadinejad will also be asked why he \"hesitated for 11 days\" to act on a demand Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to reinstate intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, who was sacked by Ahmadinejad in 2011, and to elaborate on his snap dismissal of former foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, during a trip to Africa. The power struggle has pitted Ahmadinejad against Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters in Iran. Ahmadinejad and his policies have been the target of criticism by legislators, clerics as well as state-run media. Other questions that will be put to the president include those about Iran\\'s slacking economic growth, and why his administration failed to promote the Islamic dress code that calls for women to wear the traditional veil. Legislators behind the initiative allege Ahmadinejad promoted Iranian nationalism instead of Islamic values. According to the statement, Ahmadinejad is also to explain his ties to Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, whose daughter is married to the president\\'s son. Ahmadinejad\\'s opponents content he is trying to push Mashei for president after his own term expires next year.',\n",

The action on Thursday by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) aims to enforce EU sanctions discouraging Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. It will go a long way toward isolating Iran financially. SWIFT is a banking hub crucial to oil, financial transactions and other trades and global financial transactions are impossible to conduct without using it. Because of its reach, SWIFT\\'s decision to cut off some 30 Iranian banks and subsidiaries could hinder not only banking but also the country\\'s lucrative crude oil industry and possibly hurt Iranian households that depend on remittances from relatives living abroad. \"Disconnecting banks is an extraordinary and unprecedented step for SWIFT,\\'\\' said Lazaro Campos, chief executive of the company. \"It is a direct result of international and multilateral action to intensify financial sanctions against Iran.\\'\\' The announcements coincided with news that major money exchange houses in the United Arab Emirates, an important trading hub for Iran, have stopped handling the Iranian currency over the last several weeks.',\n",

Catherine Ashton, the European Union\\'s foreign policy chief, told reporters the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany would meet the Iranian delegation again in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on May 23. The West suspects that Iran is enriching uranium to build a nuclear bomb, but Tehran says its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only. Ashton said the talks on Saturday, the first since the collapse of similar negotiations in early 2011, were a step towards a \"sustained process of serious dialogue\". \"We expect that subsequent meetings will lead to concrete steps towards a comprehensive negotiated solution, which restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme,\" she said. Ashton said that the next round of talks would be preceded by a preparatory meeting of deputies. Earlier, a diplomat close to the negotiations had described Saturday\\'s talks as \"completely different\" from previous meetings, with no pre-conditions set by the Iranian delegation. The diplomat said Saeed Jalili, the leader of the Iranian delegation, steered clear of the preconditions he had set at the last meeting in early 2011. \"He seems to have come with an objective to get into a process which is a serious process, which is about what we want to talk about,\" said the envoy, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"I would say it has been a useful morning\\'s work.\" Another diplomat, who also requested anonymity, described the atmosphere as \"positive\".',\n",

Obama said in his speech to world leaders on Tuesday that Iran has repeatedly failed to demonstrate that its nuclear programme is peaceful and has failed to meet its obligations to the United Nations. He also said the Iranian government has been propping up the dictatorship in Syria and supporting terrorist groups abroad. \"The United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\\'\\' the president said. This is Obama\\'s final international address before the November elections. He also insisted there has been \"progress\" since the Arab Spring but said the recent turmoil in the Muslim world showed the hard task of achieving true democracy. \"The events of the last two weeks speak to the need for all of us to address honestly the tensions between the West and an Arab World moving to democracy,\" Obama said. Syria \\'calamity\\' Opening the meeting on Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described the fighting in Syria as \"a regional calamity with global ramifications\". \"It is the duty of our generation to put an end to impunity for international crimes in Syria and elsewhere. \"',\n",

        " {u'content': u'Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said the only way to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons was by setting \"a clear red line\" to stop its atomic programme. \"At this late hour, there is only one way to peacefully prevent Iran from getting atomic bombs and that\\'s by placing a clear red line on Iran\\'s nuclear weapons programme,\" Netanyahu said in a speech at the UN General Assembly on Thursday. \"Red lines don\\'t lead to war; red lines prevent war.\" \\'World\\'s future at stake\\' Mark Regev, spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister\\'s office, told Al Jazeera: \"Do we just let the clock tick itself out? No, we establish a clear red line. That\\'s the way to maintain the peace, and make war further distant.\" He added: \"Obviously in the framework for today with an extremely radical regime in Tehran ... It\\'s not about Israel, as our Arab neighbours share our concerns.\" During his speech, Netanyahu alleged Iran was already 70 per cent of the way through the process of enriching enough uranium to fuel a bomb, and must be prevented from reaching the 90 per cent level.',\n",

        " {u'content': u'Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel\\'s prime minister, has won pledges from Francois Hollande, the French president, to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Netanyahu visited Paris on Wednesday and praised France for the pressure it has put on Iran and called for \"even tougher sanctions\" than the ones currently in place. But the prime minister had no sympathy for any possible Israeli military strike against Tehran. Netanyahu has previously warned that his government would strike Iranian nuclear facilities as sanctions have not stopped Tehran\\'s quest for developing an atomic bomb. Iran insists its nuclear programme is intended for generating power and is not meant for military use. Hollande said he wanted \"concrete acts and gestures\" from Iran to show it was not pursuing nuclear arms, adding that he would back \"other sanctions\" if Tehran failed to do so. Netenyahu said: \"The sanctions are taking a bite out of Iran\\'s economy ... unfortunately they have not stopped the Iranian [nuclear] programme.\"',\n",

        " {u'content': u'John Kerry, the newly-appointed US secretary of state, has described recent developments in Iran\\'s nuclear programme as disturbing and concerning for the United States. Speaking at his first press conference since being confirmed as secretary of state on Friday, Kerry said Tehran must address the concerns of the international community at talks in Kazakhstan at the end of of this month. \"The international community is ready to respond if Iran comes prepared to talk, real substance and to address concerns that could not be more clear about their nuclear programme. If they don\\'t then they will choose to leave themselves more isolated\", he said. Kerry\\'s comments come amid growing frustration with UN sanctions in the Islamic Republic. A new Gallup poll has shown that the Iranian people are increasingly baring the economic brunt of the US-backed Western sanctions against their nation.',\n",

        " {u'content': u'Hundreds of thousands of people have marched through the Iranian capital and other cities chanting \"Death to America\" as Iran marked the 34th anniversary of the Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed Shah. In Tehran, crowds waving Iranian flags and portraits of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini walked towards the landmark Azadi [Freedom] Square, in a government-sponsored rally on Sunday. Marchers also chanted \"Death to Israel\" as they headed for the square, some waving posters of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the crowds in the square that Iran was now a \"nuclear state\" and added that Western countries were hampering genuine reform in the country. \"Iran has become nuclear, and so Iran\\'s enemies are unhappy,\" he told cheering crowds. Iran also held similar rallies nationwide, especially in large provincial capitals such as Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz and Kerman. At the Tehran rally, foreign media were being closely monitored and allowed to cover the event from officially designated areas only. The rally marks February 11 when the army declared solidarity with the people, turning its back on Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Ten days beforehand, Khomeini returned in triumph from exile in France to lead the revolutionaries to power. Tehran is currently under a series of international sanctions aimed at curbing its controversial nuclear programme of uranium enrichment. World powers and Iran\\'s arch regional foe Israel suspect that Tehran is trying to develop atomic weapons under the cover of its civilian programme, a charge repeatedly and vehemently denied by the Islamic republic. The sanctions have led to a severe economic crisis, hindering Iran\\'s banking system and limiting its oil exports, the country\\'s main foreign revenue earner. According to a recent survey by the US polling firm Gallup, Iran\\'s nuclear programme is supported by a large majority of its population.',\n",
